# ⏱️ Timed Math Challenge (Python)

A fun, fast-paced Python command-line game that challenges users with **10 random math problems**. See how quickly and accurately you can solve them - great for practicing arithmetic or building beginner Python skills!

---

## 🧩 Features

- Generates **random math problems** using:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
- Tracks the **total number of attempts**, including incorrect ones
- Measures the **total time** taken to complete all problems
- **Validates input** to ensure user enters numbers only
- Simple, engaging feedback after each response

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- The game generates 10 random math problems using +, -, or *, with numbers between 2 and 12.
- A timer starts as soon as the user presses Enter.
- The user must solve each problem correctly to move on.
- Each guess (correct or incorrect) is counted as an attempt.
- After all problems are solved, the program displays: Total time taken , Total number of attempts
